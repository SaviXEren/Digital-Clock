# Digital-Clock
The Digital Clock Web App is a modern, single-page application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays the current time and date with real-time updates. It features a responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes and offers users the ability to toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats, with an AM/PM indicator shown in 12-hour mode. The current date is displayed in a full, human-readable format, enhancing the utility of the app beyond just timekeeping. A light/dark theme switcher allows users to customize the appearance based on their preference or environment, with smooth CSS transitions providing a polished user experience. The digital-style font and animated updates give the clock a sleek and professional look, making it both functional and visually appealing. This project serves as a great example of how JavaScript can bring interactivity to a static webpage while maintaining clean code separation across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
